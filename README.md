# RollingStones
Hacknar√∂k IoT Project 24.03.2017.

## Description
The idea of project is to provide an information about the amount of people being at the specific place at the specific time. It can be useful when choosing a location to place some ad banners or planning the city bus routes. Such data is collected by a bunch of wi-fi signal receivers (the rolling-stones) spreaded throughout the city. The only condition to get data from a particular person is to have him the wi-fi module enabled in smartphone. There is no need to collect the MAC address of anybody - the one and only information coming out of the stones, will be the number of people it spotted right now.
